    "The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate and compare multiple solar panel system options for a residential client in Denver, Colorado. Real-world solar design requires balancing several competing factors, including upfront installation cost, available roof area, long-term energy production, system degradation, and financial return over time. Different clients may prioritize minimizing cost, maximizing energy production, or achieving the greatest long-term value from their investment.<br>\n",
    "In this report, a set of Python functions is developed to model solar system performance and financial outcomes over a 25-year system lifetime. These functions calculate system specifications, yearly energy production with degradation, cumulative financial value with increasing electricity rates, and identify the optimal panel option based on different client priorities. Three panel options—budget, standard, and premium—are analyzed under identical site conditions to allow for a fair comparison.<br>\n",
    "The results of this analysis provide quantitative insight into energy output, payback period, lifetime cost-effectiveness, and overall value, supporting an informed engineering recommendation for the client.\n"

    "This analysis compared three solar panel options using consistent site conditions and a 25-year system lifetime. While the budget panels offered the lowest upfront cost, the premium panels consistently outperformed the other options in terms of energy production, lowest degradation rate, and final cumulative value. All three systems achieved a payback period of approximately five years, indicating that solar is a financially viable investment for this client regardless of panel choice.<br>\n",
    "When considering long-term performance, the premium panel option produced the most total energy, experienced the smallest production decline over time, and delivered the highest net financial value both at year 10 and at the end of the system lifetime. Additionally, all options generated electricity at a significantly lower lifetime cost per kilowatt-hour than the current utility rate, reinforcing the economic advantage of solar energy.<br>\n",
    "Based on the results and the client’s uncertainty about moving within 10 years, the premium panel option is recommended. It provides the strongest combination of early value, long-term return, and maximum energy production, making it the most robust and future-proof choice among the options evaluated.\n"
