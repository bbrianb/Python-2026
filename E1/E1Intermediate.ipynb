    "QUESTION 1\n",
    "In the first scenario, although 600 square feet of space allows for a lot of panels, the limiting factor is budget because a budget of only 12000 dollars with 3000 dollars of fixed costs and 425 dollars per panel allows for only 21 panels.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second scenario, 400 square feet of space is not enough for a lot of panels even though the budget is high enough for more panels.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the third scenario, although there is a ton of space, the budget is also very high and is enough to fill the entire area with panels.\n",
    "\n",
    "QUESTION 2\n",
    "The second option has the shortest payback period because the total installation cost is not that high and the value of energy is $0.18, which is higher than the first scenario, and the panels produce a lot of energy per year.\n",
    "\n",
    "QUESTION 3\n",
    "Scenario 2 has the highest ROI, scenario 1 has the second most and scenario 3 has the least ROI.\n",
    "\n",
    "QUESTION 4\n",
    "If the rate increase in the first scenario were 5 instead of 3, the payback period would still be 7 years. This implies that a rate increase <= 5% does not have much of an effect on the payback period.\n",
    "\n",
    "QUESTION 5\n",
    "The total savings if the cost of panels drops 10% is about $5,000 higher for scenario 2."
